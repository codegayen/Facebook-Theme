==================================================
Developed by Edge and Google, that support the best practices of user interface 
design. Backed by open-source code, Material streamlines collaboration 
between designers and developers, and helps teams quickly build 
beautiful products.

Material Design comes designed with a built-in, baseline theme that 
can be used as-is, straight out of the proverbial box. This includes 
default colors for primary, secondary, and their variants. This 
baseline theme also includes additional colors that define your UI, 
such as the colors for backgrounds, surfaces, errors, typography, 
and iconography. All of these colors can be  for your needs.

Principes of Material Design Color System

Hierarchical
Color indicates which elements are interactive, how they relate to 
other elements, and their level of prominence. Important elements 
should stand out the most.

Legible
Text and important elements, like icons, should meet legibility 
standards when appearing on colored backgrounds, across all screen 
and device types.

Expressive
Reinforce brand by showing brand colors at memorable moments 
that reinforce your brand’s style.

Primary color
A primary color is the color displayed most frequently across your 
app’s screens and components. If you don’t have a secondary color, 
your primary color can also be used to accent elements.

Secondary color
A secondary color provides more ways to accent and distinguish your 
product. Having a secondary color is optional, and should be applied 
sparingly to accent select parts of  UI.
